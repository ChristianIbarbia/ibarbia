The New TMX125 Alpha is powered by the legendary Overhead Valve (OHV) engine, making it unique from other motorbikes.

This OHV engine uses a push rod to balance acceleration and control for hours of easy and hassle-free operations while being fuel-efficient at 62.5km/L at 45Km/H constant speed.

And to meet the customersâ€™ requirement for best balance of engine power and acceleration, the rear sprocket is improved from 44T to 38T, making it perfect bike for daily commuting usage.
