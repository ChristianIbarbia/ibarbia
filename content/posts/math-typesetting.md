### Honda BeAT Overview

![alt](/2.png)

The Honda BeAT is a scooter that's reinforced with bits of style and practicality in one affordable package. Locally, this bike is made available in Two variants, respectively the Playful and Premium. Prices range from P71,400 to P72,400.

Standard across all variants are tubeless tires, a key shutter system, a parking brake lock, and a side-stand switch. Exclusive for the Premium (CBS) trim is the idling-stop system, which automatically switches off the engine during traffic stops, and back on again when it’s time to accelerate, to avoid unnecessary fuel consumption.

All variants get the same 110cc single-cylinder engine that's capable of producing 8 hp and 9 Nm of torque. That powerplant can only be paired with an automatic transmission.

For safety and security, the Combi-Brake System (CBS) is a standard feature on the BeAT’s Premium variant. What CBS does is balance the braking force between the front and rear for optimum stopping power.
