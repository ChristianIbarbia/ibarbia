Honda Philippines introduced the ADV 160 in the local market in October 2022. With its aim to boost its presence in the scooter segment in the country, the Japanese brand equipped this bike with advanced features, armored with adventure-ready style, but ultimately focused for the urban jungle.

The Honda ADV 160 comes with cool features such as LED headlight with positioning light, LED taillight, and hazard lamp as well as the Honda smart key system. For convenience, this scooter has a 28-liter luggage box with a seat stopper, adjustable windscreen, a console box with a power outlet and a full digital meter panel for riding information.

Improving its stability and rideability are the telescopic front fork and a rear twin shock-sub tank. The safety of its rider is then provided by front and rear disc brakes, equipped with an option of either Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) or Honda's combi-brake system. It also comes with the Idling Stop System which makes this scooter more fuel-efficient.

At the heart of the Honda ADV is a 159.6cc four-stroke, liquid-cooled, Single Overhead Cam (SOHC) engine that can churn out a maximum output of 15.6 hp and 14 Nm of torque. Its powertrain is then partnered with a V-Belt automatic transmission.
