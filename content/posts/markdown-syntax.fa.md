The Honda CLICK160 is an automatic scooter in the CLICK family of models that feature a new engine along with bigger and sportier looks in comparison to its predecessors. The CLICK160 is the successor to the widely successful CLICK150i, and it now features a revamped design that features more premium touches as well as bigger scooter looks. Launched in 2022, this scooter is made available with one version. The said variant retails at 116,900 for all colors which include Matte Pearl Crater White, Matte Gunpowder Black Metallic, and Matte Solar Red Metallic.

Key equipment in the Click 150i includes LED taillights and headlights, a stylish muffler, a digital instrument cluster, a Combined Braking System (CBS) which can pull the front and rear brakes at the same time, Park Brake Lock, Honda's Smart Key System, a USB charger, and an idling-stop system that switches off the engine during traffic stops, and back on again when it’s time to accelerate in order to avoid unnecessary fuel consumption.

Its beating heart is a liquid-cooled, four-stroke, SOHC, 157cc engine that now produces 15 hp and 13.8Nm of torque, that's about a 2-horsepower gain and a slightly beefier torque figure compared to the outgoing CLICK150i. The engine is fuel-injected and is mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). As for the engine's specifications, it comes with a four-valve head, it's liquid-cooled, and it features Honda's PGM-Fi fuel injection system that helps it get its fuel efficiency rating of 46.7 km/L—as tested under the World Motorcycle Test Cycle Method and as advertised by Honda Motorcycles Philippines.
